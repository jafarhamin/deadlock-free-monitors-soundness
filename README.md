Deadlock-Free Monitors: A Soundness Proof in Coq

This repository contains a soundness proof, carried out by [Coq proof assistant v8.6](https://coq.inria.fr), for deadlock-free monitors, a modular approach to verify deadlock-freedom of programs synchronized by condition variables.

An HTML representation of this proof can be found [here](https://www.hamin.be/dfm/html/dfm.html).

For more details about the approach please look at:

* [Some deadlock-free programs](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/examples/monitors), verified in [VeriFast](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/), using the proposed proof rules
